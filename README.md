# FaceD

- A program for basic frontal face detection using Pillow and OpenCV.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Introduction

- A package inspired by UMich Coursera's Python Specialization.
- [`{FaceD}`](https://github.com/AlphaPrime7/faced) is simply a package that will take in a zip file of images in any format (.JPG or .PNG) and attempt to detect faces. This will crop the faces and return them to a canvas. Try out the package using the data sample zip files provided with the package.
- This package is highly experimental and might be totally useless for some people.
- Hope this helps someone as much as it helped me in mastering python.


## ‚è¨ Installation

### Development version

### PyPi Version

## üõÇ Quality Control (QC)

- Utilized inbuilt unit testing to test results vs expectations and everything seems to work just fine.

## üéá Epilogue

- Working on CamFaceD which is a dynamic faced platform. CamFaceD can be used to train face detection although on a limited capacity. More to learn on this but steadily making progress and grateful for what I have learned so far.

## Warning

- Running this package means you will need your own tesseract engine for text identification. Install it and point your system to the executable.

- The program also requires an in built classifier and this might or might not work for OS other than windows. I will check on that later but that is all for now.

## Upload to TestPi

- Create account and token (hate this bs).
- Create twine powershell file in src directory.
- Upload, install and test.
- Pretty much same for the real PyPi.
